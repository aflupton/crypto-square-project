## Description

_Form takes user input and arrays it in a matrix, which when read by the program produces an encrypted message in the form of a new string._

_Specs:_
* _The program removes spaces, and splits inputted words into separate arrays of lowercase letters._
* _Input Example: "The quick brown fox jumped over the dog."_
* _Output Example: "t", "h", "e", etc._
* _The program arranges the array of letter-strings into a table, optimizing for squareness, populating the rows left to right._
* _Input Example: A sentence containing 69 characters._
* _Output Example: A table with 9 rows and 8 columns._
* _The program should assemble new arrays by reading down each column from top to bottom, adding a space after each five-letter block to simulate word-formation._
* _Input Example: A column reading "d", "a", "e", "e", "r", etc._
* _Output Example: "daeer rewas ..."_
* _The program should join these new arrays together and then display them to the user as a single string._
* _Clicking anywhere in the form box or button hides the previous output._
