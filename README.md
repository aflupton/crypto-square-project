## Description

_Form takes user input and then places it in a table, which when read produces an encrypted message._

_Specs:_
* _The program should split inputted words into separate strings of lowercase letters._
* _Input Example: "The quick brown fox jumped over the dog."_
* _Output Example: "t", "h", "e", etc._
* _The program should arrange the letter-strings into a table, optimizing for squareness, populating the rows left to right._
* _Input Example: A sentence containing 69 characters._
* _Output Example: A table with 9 rows and 8 columns._
* _The program should assemble new strings by reading down each column from top to bottom._
* _Input Example: A column reading "d", "a", "e", "e", "r", etc._
* _Output Example: "daeer..."_
* _The program should join these new strings together and then display them to the user._
